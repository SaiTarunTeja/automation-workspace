==> execute specific methods in a specific class, for this type of execution we can use 
	<include> inside the <methods> which is inside <class> inside the xml file


How to create testNG class
==========================

To create a TestNG class in Eclipse, 
first ensure that the TestNG plugin is installed via the Eclipse Marketplace 
or by adding the TestNG library through the project's build path.
 Once set up, navigate to the project's src folder, 
 right-click on the desired package, and select New > Other from the context menu.
 In the dialog that appears, choose TestNG Class under the TestNG category.
 The source folder and package name will be prepopulated; enter a class name (e.g., Test1) 
 and optionally select annotations like @BeforeMethod and @AfterMethod to include setup and teardown methods.
 Click Finish to generate the class, which will include a default f() method, beforeMethod(), 
 and afterMethod() if selected, along with necessary imports.
 Alternatively, you can use the shortcut Ctrl+N, select TestNG Class, and follow the same steps.
 
 How to create testNg.xml
 ========================
 
 There are two primary methods to create a testng.xml file in Eclipse.

first method
------------
The first method involves manually creating the file. 
Right-click on your project folder in the Project Explorer, 
select New, then File. Name the file testng.xml and click Finish. 
This will create an empty XML file in your project. 
You can then add the necessary TestNG suite configuration, 
such as defining the suite name, test name, 
and including specific test classes using the <suite>, <test>, and <classes> tags.
 
 A basic example includes the following structure:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "https://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd">
<suite name="Suite">
  <test thread-count="5" name="Test">
    <classes>
      <class name="practice.SampleTest"/>
    </classes>
  </test>
</suite>


second method
-------------
The second and often preferred method is using Eclipse’s built-in Convert to TestNG feature. 
Right-click on your project folder in the Project Explorer, navigate to TestNG, and select Convert to TestNG.
 A dialog will appear prompting you to configure the test suite. After clicking Finish, 
 Eclipse will automatically generate a testng.xml file in your project directory with default settings 
 based on your existing test classes.
 You can then open and modify this file to include or exclude specific classes, methods, 
 or packages, set test dependencies, define parallel execution, or adjust priorities.

 [ERROR] ==> Downloading from external resources is disabled in hibernate dtd
 ============================================================================
 The "Downloading external resources is disabled" error in a TestNG.xml file typically occurs 
 when Eclipse is unable to access external DTD or XSD files required for XML validation and code assistance. 
 This issue is commonly linked to disabled download settings within Eclipse's preferences.

To resolve this, navigate to Window > Preferences > XML (Wild Web Developer) 
and ensure the "Download external resources like referenced DTD, XSD" option is checked.
 This setting allows Eclipse to fetch necessary schema definitions from remote sources, 
 which is essential for proper validation of the TestNG.xml file.

Alternatively, if the issue persists, check the Maven settings under Window > Preferences > Maven and 
ensure that "Download artifact sources" and "Download artifact JavaDoc" are enabled.
 These settings can influence the availability of external resources during project builds and validations.

For users encountering this error specifically in the context of TestNG and Maven projects, 
enabling these download options should resolve the warning and allow proper XML file processing.
 If network or proxy settings are interfering, verify the Network Connections settings 
 under Window > Preferences > General > Network Connections and ensure a direct connection is used 
 instead of a manual proxy configuration.
